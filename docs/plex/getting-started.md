# Getting Started

Create your free account, accept your invitation, and start watching. The whole process takes about 5 minutes.

## Step 1 -- Create your free Plex account

![Plex sign-up page](images/plex-signup.png){ width="600" }

1. Open a web browser on your computer, phone, or tablet and go to: **[plex.tv/sign-up](https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/)**
2. You can sign up using your **email address**, or sign in with Google, Facebook, or Apple. Use whichever you're most comfortable with.
3. Choose a **username** and **password** you'll remember. Write them down if it helps!
4. If Plex asks you about **"Plex Pass"** or any paid upgrade -- just look for a button that says **"Skip"** or **"Maybe later."** You don't need to pay for anything.

!!! tip

    If you used an email address to sign up, check your inbox for a confirmation email from Plex and click the link inside. Check your spam folder if you don't see it.

## Step 2 -- Accept the server invitation

The server owner will send you a **friend invitation** through Plex. Here's how to find and accept it:

1. Check your email for a message from Plex with the subject **"You've been invited to share some media in Plex"** (or something similar).
2. Click the **"Accept Invitation"** button inside the email. This will open Plex in your browser.
3. If you're already signed in, the server's libraries will appear automatically. If not, sign in with the account you just created.

!!! note "Don't see an email?"

    Ask the server owner to re-send the invitation. Make sure they have the same email address you used to create your Plex account. Also check your spam/junk folder.

## Step 3 -- Sign in and start watching

![Plex sidebar with shared libraries](images/plex-sidebar-libraries.png){ width="600" }

1. Go to **[app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv)** in any web browser.
2. Sign in with your account.
3. Look at the left sidebar. You should see the **shared server's libraries** listed there -- things like "Movies," "TV Shows," etc. Click any of them to start browsing.

!!! tip

    Plex also has its own free movies and live TV channels. These are separate from the server you've been invited to. The shared libraries from your server owner will have their own section -- look for them in the sidebar.
