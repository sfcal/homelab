# Setting Up Your Devices

You can watch on almost anything -- your TV, phone, tablet, or computer. Find your device below and follow the steps.

!!! note "Before you start"

    Make sure you've already created your free Plex account and accepted the server invitation.
    If you haven't, head to [Getting Started](getting-started.md) first.

## Computer (any web browser)

This is the easiest way to watch -- no app needed.

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge -- any will work).
2. Go to **[app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv)**
3. Sign in with your Plex account. That's it -- browse and play.

## iPhone or iPad

1. Open the **App Store** on your device.
2. Search for **"Plex"** and download the app (it's free -- look for the orange play-button icon).
3. Open the app and sign in with your Plex account.
4. The shared libraries will appear in the sidebar. Tap one to start browsing.

!!! tip

    Plex may ask you to "activate" the app by going to **plex.tv/link** on a computer and entering a code. Just follow the on-screen instructions -- it only takes a moment.

## Android phone or tablet

1. Open the **Google Play Store**.
2. Search for **"Plex"** and install the app.
3. Open the app and sign in with your Plex account.
4. The shared server's libraries will appear automatically. Start browsing!

## Roku

1. From the Roku home screen, go to **Streaming Channels** (or **Search**).
2. Search for **"Plex"** and select **Add Channel**.
3. Open the Plex app. It will show a **4-letter code** on your TV screen.
4. On your phone or computer, go to **[plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link)**, sign in, and type in the code. Your Roku is now connected.

## Amazon Fire TV / Fire Stick

1. From the Fire TV home screen, go to **Find > Search** (or use the Alexa voice remote).
2. Search for **"Plex"** and select **Download**.
3. Open the Plex app. You'll see a **4-letter code**.
4. On your phone or computer, go to **[plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link)**, sign in, and enter the code.

## Apple TV

1. Open the **App Store** on your Apple TV.
2. Search for **"Plex"** and download the app.
3. Open Plex. You'll see a code on your TV screen.
4. Go to **[plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link)** on another device, sign in, and enter the code.

## Smart TV (Samsung, LG, Vizio, etc.)

1. Open your TV's built-in **app store** (Samsung: Smart Hub, LG: LG Content Store, Vizio: SmartCast Apps).
2. Search for **"Plex"** and install it.
3. Open the app. You'll see a **4-letter code**.
4. Go to **[plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link)** on your phone or computer, sign in, and enter the code.

!!! note

    Some older smart TVs may not have Plex available in their app store. If that's the case, a **Roku** or **Fire Stick** is an affordable way to add Plex to any TV with an HDMI port.

## Linking any device -- the universal method

Nearly every Plex app on a TV or streaming device uses the same linking process:

1. Install and open the Plex app on your device. A **4-letter code** appears on screen.
2. On any other device (your phone works great), open a browser and go to **[plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link)**.
3. Sign in to your Plex account and type in the code. Done -- your device is connected.

!!! tip

    You only need to do this once per device. After linking, the app stays signed in.
