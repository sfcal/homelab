# Requesting Content

Want to watch something that isn't on the server yet? You can request it directly from Plex -- no extra apps or accounts needed.

## How it works

This server uses **Pulsarr** to automatically monitor your Plex watchlist. When you add a movie or TV show to your watchlist, Pulsarr detects it and begins downloading it to the server. In most cases, the content will appear in your library within a few minutes to a few hours depending on availability.

## How to request something

1. Search for the movie or TV show you want in Plex (even if it's not on the server yet, Plex will show results from its online database).
2. Open the title's detail page.
3. Click the **"Add to Watchlist"** button (the bookmark icon).
4. That's it -- Pulsarr will pick up your request automatically.

!!! tip

    You can manage your watchlist from any Plex app or from [app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv). Anything you add will be detected.

## What to expect

- **Movies** are typically available within a few hours of being requested.
- **TV shows** will be monitored for new episodes automatically once added.
- If something isn't available or can't be found, reach out to the server owner.

!!! note

    Not every request can be fulfilled. Some content may not be available due to region restrictions, release timing, or other limitations. If your request doesn't show up after a day or so, just ask the server owner.

## Removing a request

If you change your mind, simply remove the title from your Plex watchlist. You can do this from the title's detail page by clicking the bookmark icon again.
