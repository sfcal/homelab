# Browsing & Playing

Now that you're signed in, here's how to find something to watch and control playback.

## Finding something to watch

### Browse the library

![Plex library grid view](images/plex-library-grid.png){ width="600" }

On the left side of the screen (or in the menu on mobile), you'll see the shared libraries -- usually labeled something like **"Movies"** and **"TV Shows."** Tap or click one to see everything available.

Inside a library, content is displayed as a grid of poster artwork. You can scroll through to see what's available, much like browsing Netflix or any other streaming app.

### Use search

![Plex search bar](images/plex-search.png){ width="600" }

Look for the **magnifying glass icon** at the top of the screen. Type the name of a movie, show, or actor, and Plex will show you matching results from the shared server.

!!! tip

    Search looks across all shared libraries at once, so you don't need to pick "Movies" or "TV Shows" first.

### Sort and filter

Inside any library, look for **sort** and **filter** options near the top of the page. You can sort by title, year, rating, or date added. Filters let you narrow down by genre, year, or resolution -- helpful when you're not sure what you want.

## Playing something

![Plex title detail page](images/plex-detail-page.png){ width="600" }

1. **Click or tap a title** to open its detail page. You'll see a description, rating, cast info, and the play button.
2. **Press the big Play button** to start watching immediately. For TV shows, you'll see a list of seasons and episodes -- pick the one you want and press play.
3. **Playback controls** appear when you move your mouse (or tap the screen on mobile). You'll see familiar buttons: play/pause, skip forward/back, volume, and fullscreen.

!!! tip

    If you stop watching partway through, Plex remembers where you left off. Next time you open that title, just press **"Resume"** to pick up right where you stopped.

## Subtitles & audio

![Plex playback controls](images/plex-playback-controls.png){ width="600" }

During playback, look for a **speech bubble icon** or **settings gear** in the playback controls. From there you can:

- Turn on **subtitles** if they're available (many titles include English subtitles and sometimes other languages).
- Switch between **audio tracks** if multiple languages are provided.

## Your Watchlist

Found something interesting but not ready to watch it yet? Click the **bookmark icon** (or the **"Add to Watchlist"** button) on any title's detail page. You'll find your saved titles later under **"Watchlist"** in the sidebar.

Think of it like a "watch later" list -- it's personal to your account, so no one else sees it.

## Continue Watching

Plex keeps track of everything you've started. Look for a **"Continue Watching"** row on the home screen -- it shows titles you haven't finished yet, so you can jump right back in.
