## Quick answers

### Is this really free?

Yes! You don't need to pay anything. When you create your Plex account, you may see ads for "Plex Pass" -- that's an optional upgrade you **do not need.** Just skip past it.

### What can I watch?

Everything the server owner has shared with you. This typically includes movies, TV shows, and sometimes music or photos. Browse the library to see what's available.

### Do I need to download anything?

Not necessarily. You can watch in any web browser at [app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv). For the best experience on a TV or mobile device, you'll want the free Plex app -- see the [Devices](devices.md) guide.

### Who do I ask if something isn't working?

Reach out to the person who invited you. They manage the server and can help troubleshoot.
