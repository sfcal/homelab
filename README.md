# Homelab Infrastructure as Code

A complete infrastructure-as-code solution for managing a home Kubernetes cluster running on Proxmox VMs. This repository contains automation for the entire lifecycle - from VM template creation to Kubernetes application deployment.

```bash
apt update && apt install -y curl && bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfcal/homelab/refs/heads/main/deploy/controlplane.sh)"
```

## Network Structure
![Network](docs/assets/network.drawio.svg)

## Multi-Environment Support

This repository supports multiple environments with location-based naming:

- **WIL**: Development/testing environment
- **NYC**: Production environment

Each environment can have its own configuration while sharing common base components.

## Deployment - Zero to Hero

There are 4 steps to fully deploy this homelab from scratch.

### Step 0: Prerequisites
### Step 1: Machine Preparation
### Step 2: Packer Template Generation
### Step 3: Terraform VM Deployment
### Step 4: Ansible Kubernetes Installation

## Maintenance and Updates

- **Templates**: Rebuild Packer templates when OS updates are needed
- **Infrastructure**: Use Terraform to scale or modify VM resources
- **Kubernetes**: Update through GitOps with FluxCD
- **Applications**: Manage through Kubernetes manifests or Docker Compose for standalone services
